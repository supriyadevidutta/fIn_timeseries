Because the two datapoints are close, the real body is small. The real body of the hanging man can be black or white, but it must be small. The hanging man will have a long lower shadow which is two or three times the length of the real body. The low and the high of the candle (in our case, trading day) is at extreme ends of the price range during the trading day. There may or may not be an upper shadow. If there is an upper shadow it will be small. but usually the upper shadow is non existent which means that that open or close and the high are the same."
